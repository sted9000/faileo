&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;36 hours of poker playing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 hour of reading (6/7 days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;70 push-ups (7/7 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main objective of a lot of poker playing is well aligned with my professional goal. The reading objective is to develop the habit and identity of &lt;em&gt;being a reader&lt;/em&gt;, and the push-up goal is a little challenge my friend wanted to do (it is small, a good way to connect, and is health promoting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this week is quite simple and relatively easy. I want to get off to a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

Hopefully the first of many fruitful challenges that help guide us towards where we want to be and form us into who we want to become. This first challenge will be the testing ground both for ourselves and the faileo challenge system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekly Criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post a list of weekly objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mark the prior week as completed (accomplished all objectives) or failed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write a brief description of the coming week’s objectives and how they connect to our goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week’s list of objectives will be calibrated based on the last weeks outcome. If you succeeded, up the difficulty; if you failed, lower the difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duration of this challenge is &lt;strong&gt;12 weeks&lt;/strong&gt;. Each participant is putting up &lt;strong&gt;$200usd&lt;/strong&gt; as an incentive to complete the challenge. To qualify to win you must successfully complete at a minimum &lt;strong&gt;six&lt;/strong&gt; weeks of holding to the weekly criteria and accomplishing your weekly objectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Welcome to the inaugural faileo goals challenge.
