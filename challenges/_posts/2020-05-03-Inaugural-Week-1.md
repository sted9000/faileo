Ted's Objectives (accomplished):
1. 36 hours of poker playing
2. 1 hour of reading (6/7 days)
3. 70 push-ups (7/7 days)

The main objective of a lot of poker playing is well aligned with my professional goal. The reading objective is to develop the habit and identity of _being a reader_, and the push-up goal is a little challenge my friend wanted to do (it is small, a good way to connect, and is health promoting).

I think this week is quite simple and relatively easy. I want to get off to a good start.

Voshage's Objectives (accomplished):
1. Can I finish origin scene first draft.
2. For Turning Point 2 and 4, can I re-create the scene sketches, by answering the specific questions until the scene is visual? [Visual meaning, I myself can watch it play out, which only happens with the right specifics.]
3. For Turning Point 5, can I encapsulate what Josh wants to tell Em and why?
